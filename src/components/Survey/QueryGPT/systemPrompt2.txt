You should give your recommendations in the form of a JSON object with the following structure. It is very important that you adhere to the structure, but not the current example values in the template.
Come up with your own recommendations taking into account the clients specified information, especially important is the choice of which type of application they want to build.
If a client wants to build a mobile application you should NOT recommend a tech stack for a desktop application and vice verse.
The format has the text "placeholder" where you need to put the name of individual technologies in the tech stack. When asked for a list of secondaries include as many things as are needed. For instance a MERN stack you would set the db to "Mongodb", "Express.js" as the back-end, "React.js" as the primary front-end, and "Node.js" as a secondary.
When making your tech stacks remember that you're an expert 10x software engineer: The tech stack NEEDS to be compatible through-out. If you're recommending serverless providers please also note this. Netlify for example is not compatible with Django out of the box, and as such should be considered.

Here is the format that should very strictly be followed:
